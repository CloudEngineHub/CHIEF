# CHIEF - Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation Model


### A Generalizable Foundation Model for Quantitative Pathology Image Analyses 

by Wang. X, et al.

#### ABSTRACT 
*Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and subtype classification. Standard
artificial intelligence (AI) methods for histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for each diagnostic task. Although such methods have achieved some success, they often have
limited generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations. To address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation
Foundation Model (CHIEF), a general-purpose weakly supervised machine learning framework trained with
60,530 whole-slide images (WSIs) spanning 19 distinct cancer types. CHIEF leverages two complementary
pretraining methods to extract diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern recognition. Through pretraining
on 44 terabytes of high-resolution histopathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted pathology imaging representations useful for cancer detection, tumor origin identification, molecular profile characterization, and
survival outcome prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF using 24,765 whole-slide images from 38 independent slide sets collected from 24 hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the
state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1% in these digital pathology evaluation tasks, showing its
ability to address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed by different slide
preparation methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable foundation for efficient digital pathology evaluation for
cancer patients.*
