# CHIEF - Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation Model


### A Generalizable Foundation Model for Quantitative Pathology Image Analyses 

by Wang. X, et al.

#### ABSTRACT 
Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and subtype evaluation. Previous stud-
ies on artificial intelligence-based histopathology image analysis focused on training task-specific models that
optimize for each diagnostic task. Although such methods attained some success, they often have limited
generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different
populations. To address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foun-
dation Model (CHIEF), a unified weakly supervised machine learning model trained with 60,530 whole-slide
images (WSIs) spanning 19 distinct cancer types. CHIEF consistently outperforms existing models for
digital pathology analyses, showing its ability to address domain shifts arising from diverse sample prepara-
tion and image acquisition methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable foundation for efficient digital pathology
evaluation for cancer patients.
